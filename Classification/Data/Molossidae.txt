*Appearance
These are small to medium bats which are usually grey, brown, or black in color, with some exceptions. Many have a distinctive pad over their noses and short, broad ears. They have a tail projecting beyond the uropatagium from which they get their name. A ring of cartilage slides up and down the tail to adjust the tail membrane. They are the only bats that can withstand altitudes of over 10,000 feet.
