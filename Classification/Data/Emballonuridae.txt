*Appearance
Most bats in this family are brown or gray, except for white ghost bats (Diclidurus) and white-striped bats (Saccopteryx). They are small to medium with a smooth face and no leaf nose. Their ears are simple and round, often united with a band of skin across the forehead, and their muzzles are short and broad. They are named after their tails which seem to be sheathed in a membrane with the tip protruding from it. Most bats have wing sacs after which the family is also named.
