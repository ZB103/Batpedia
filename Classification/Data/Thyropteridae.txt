*Social Structure
These bats roost in groups.
In T. tricolor, they form and maintain social groups over long periods. Within social groups, pairs form and maintain contact for as long as 400 consecutive days. They emit contact calls to stay with their group. There is no clear hierarchy. Male and female bats of the same group never mate.
*Reproduction
They have one offspring per year, and breeding season is from August to September. Although suspected to be polygynous, they do not exhibit mate-guarding behaviors typical in other tropical, polygynous bat species.
