*Appearance
This family is very varied but can often be identified by a simple face and lack of true noseleaf, small eyes, and small ears (exceptions being Plecotus, Idionycteris, and Euderma, whose ears fill with blood when the bat is active). Their tails are enclosed by the lower flight membranes. They are usually black, brown, or gray in color, except for Kerivoula which are known for their striking bright colors.
