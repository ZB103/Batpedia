*Appearance
These are medium bats, brown and gray in color, with large ears and toes with only two phalanges. They have a small thumb and vestigial claw as well as pads on their wrists and ankles after which they are named that produce an adhesive to cling to leaves. Unlike most bats, they sleep head-up in order to avoid losing adhesion. They have long tails that are used for support.
