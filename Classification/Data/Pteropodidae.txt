*Location
Africa, Middle East, south Asia, Philippines, north/east Australia
*Habitat
These bats are found in tropical, subtropical, and temperate environments.
*Diet
Frugivorous
Nectivorous (certain species)
*Social Structure
They are highly gregarious, very vocal, and capable of acquiring a dialect from their mothers. Most are crepuscular, some nocturnal, and a few island species diurnal. Most roost in trees of up to 1 million individuals. A few cave-roosting species occur in groups of 10 to several thousand. Solitary species and small groups tend to have less fidelity in their roosts.
*Reproduction
Some megabats are seasonal breeders, while others breed throughout the year. They have one offspring at a time.
*Seasonal Behavior
Seasonal migration
*Lifespan
25+ years
*Predators
These bats have few to no native predators, but include the mangrove monitor for some species. Non-native predators include domestic cats, rats, and brown tree snake. They are hosts for parasites such as bat flies and Demodex mites.
*Threats
Deforestation, cave disturbances, overhunting, heat waves, and human structures such as power lines and tree nets threaten populations.
